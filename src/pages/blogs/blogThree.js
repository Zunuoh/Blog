            If you have been here a long time, you might remember when I went on ITV Tonight to dispense a masterclass in saving money on energy bills.

Energy-saving is one of my favourite money topics, because once you get past the boring bullet-point lists, a whole new world of thrifty nerdery opens up.

You know those bullet-point lists. You start spotting them everything at this time of year. They go like this:

How to Save Money on Energy Bills: Beginner Level
Don an extra jumper.
Insulate your loft.
Have a shower, not a bath.
Only boil as much water as you need in your kettle.
Put off turning on your central heating for as long as you can.
Turn the light off when you leave a room.
Unplug all your devices at the wall, because standby mode costs money.
Pah! This is beginner level energy-saving. You can push it much further than that – but how far are you prepared to go?
What I didn’t know, until npower approached me to collaborate on their latest research project, was that a third of people in the UK “can’t be bothered” to make the effort to lower their bills.

What? What is this madness? I thought everybody did it these days. I accept that tin foil behind the radiator isn’t for everyone, but still… It takes only five minutes to bob onto a comparison site and find the cheapest supplier. It only takes a second to lower the dial on your thermostat by one degree, saving you up to £75 per year. Who wouldn’t do that?

As you can probably tell, the energy company’s research piqued my interest. For example, did you know 43% of the 2,000 people surveyed believe that energy-saving lightbulbs have little to zero impact on bills? Come on, people! The clue is in the name.

That said, it turns out some of the basic energy-saving advice, listed above, may not be up to scratch after all. For example, four in five of us believe showers use less water than baths. However if you have a power shower, as so many people do these days, this might not be true after all. Apparently a power shower can use up to 50 litres more than baths. A water-efficient shower head could save a household up to £195 per year.
